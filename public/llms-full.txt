- Hurdle rate: typically 8%

### What Is Venture Capital?

**Primary Definition**: Venture capital is a form of private equity financing provided to early-stage, high-potential startups in exchange for equity. VC firms invest in companies with strong growth prospects, typically in technology, healthcare, and other innovative sectors.
