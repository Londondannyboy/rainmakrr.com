## What Is Private Equity?

Private equity refers to investment funds that acquire equity ownership in companies not publicly traded on stock exchanges. PE firms raise capital from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals to buy, improve, and eventually sell companies for profit. Strategies include leveraged buyouts, growth equity, and distressed investments.

## What Is Venture Capital?

Venture capital is a form of private equity financing provided to early-stage, high-potential startups in exchange for equity. VC firms invest in companies with strong growth prospects, typically in technology, healthcare, and other innovative sectors. Funding stages include seed, Series A, B, C and beyond.
